# ifc-python
Scripts and tools for analyzing ifc with ifcopenshell and python-occ
They were developed as helpers for daily work.

For example:
- extracting all information (psets) from an ifc-file and write them to excel
- space boundaries (coming soon)
- visualization of ifc-data (under development)
- manipulating ifc

The initial scripts were done quick and dirty. This is the place were they should be evolve to productive scripts.
Any help and comments appreciated!!!

This repository serves as a collection of scripts, devloped to analyze ifc-files.
It makes extensive use of the project "IfcOpenShell"for python
